# EDA--Hotel-Booking-Analysis
## Objective

The objective of this project is to perform an EDA on the hotel booking dataset to gain some insights which will be helpful in understanding the patterns and trends in booking analysis, cancellation analysis, Revenue analysis, customer segmentation and competitive analysis. The valuable insights gained will be helpful in improving operational efficiency, better financial management, increasing revenue, and supporting data-driven decision-making and competitive positioning.

## Data Wrangling

#### (1) Duplicate Rows Removal

All duplicate rows have been eliminated.

#### (2) Handling Null Values

The null values in the "company" and "agent" columns have been substituted with 0.
The null values in the "country" column have been replaced with 'others'.
The null values in the "children" column have been replaced with the mean value of the column.

#### (3) Conversion of Columns to Appropriate Data Types

The data type of the "children," "company," and "agent" columns has been changed to integer.
The data type of the "reservation_status_date" column has been converted to date.

#### (4) Eliminating Outliers

An outlier was detected in the "ADR" column and was simply removed.

#### (5) Creation of New Columns

A new column called "total_stay" has been generated by adding the values from the "stays_in_weekend_nights" and "stays_in_week_nights" columns.
Another new column called "total_people" has been created by summing the values of "adults," "children," and "babies."

 Q5) Which is the most common channel for booking hotels?

 Q6) Which are the busiest months?

 Q7) From which country most of the guests are coming?

 Q8) How long do people stay at the hotels?

 Q9) Which hotel seems to make more revenue?

 Q10) Which hotel has a higher lead time?

 Q11) What is the preferred stay length in each hotel?

 Q12) Which hotel has a higher bookings cancellation rate?

 Q13) Which hotel has a high chance that its customer will return for another stay?

 Q14) Which channel is mostly used for the early booking of hotels?

 Q15) Which channel has a longer average waiting time?

 Q16) Which distribution channel brings better revenue-generating deals for hotels?

 Q17) Which significant distribution channel has the highest cancellation percentage?

 Q18) Does a longer waiting period or longer-lead time causes the cancellation of bookings?

 Q19) Whether not getting allotted the same room type as demand the main cause of cancellation for bookings?

 Q20) Does not allowing the same room as demanded to affect ADR?
