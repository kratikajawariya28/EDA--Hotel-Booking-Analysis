        "\n",
        "Insights on distribution channel performance, cancellation rates, and revenue generation can guide hotels in optimizing their marketing and distribution strategies. This may involve strengthening partnerships with high-performing channels, improving outreach on underperforming channels, and addressing cancellation issues through targeted measures.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Competitive Advantage:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Utilizing data-driven insights allows hotels to gain a competitive edge in the market.
